***Hi there 👋*** My name is **Maksim Zherebiatev**. I am currently a software engineer, ML engineer, and I also like sports programming. I am interested in research in the field of machine and deep learning, computational mathematics and robotics, I also explore the field of radio resource management in 5th generation networks, among other things I am interested in writing bots and just developing :))
### :computer: List of technologies
My main programming language is Python 3, because it is very useful and comfortable for performing machine learning experiments. I am familiar both with classical methods (linear regression, gradient boosting, SVM, naive Bayesian e.g.) and deep learning models. I use Google Colab and Kaggle in order to train the models. Also you can check out my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/maksimzherebyatew). But I write not only ML-related projects, I also use many other programming technologies and sometimes write software projects.

You can see set of mostly used technologies and libraries below:

### :rocket: Projects and experience

-----------------------------------------------------
In the beginning I was involved in projects related to python, such as window application, games and private sites, all of my first projects on these topics you can see here:

https://github.com/maxijer/WEB

https://github.com/maxijer/Mega_tetris      

https://github.com/maxijer/Car_Manager

------------------------------------------------------
I wrote these projects in [Yandex Lyceum](http://yandexlyceum.ru/), that's where I learned to program. During the learning process, I also wrote a lot of projects that you can see in my repositories. After that, I entered the top 80 best graduates and was invited to give a [lecture about telegram bots](https://github.com/maxijer/Shaverma).  After graduating from the lyceum, I also wrote many projects in python, java, c++ and many others.

I also went to [school for practical programming and data analysis](https://spb.hse.ru/fmcs/programming/2022/) and wrote a project for the [Mario pass game](https://github.com/maxijer/Mario). I have also participated in many laws and you can find solutions to some of them in my repositories. I became the winner of the [Big Challenges](https://konkurs.sochisirius.ru/) contest with a [bot support project](https://github.com/maxijer/Business_support_bot). One of my most interesting projects was probably the project on the [distribution of radio resources in the 5th generation networks](https://github.com/maxijer/RRM), my supervisor and I wrote and published an article at [one of the conferences](http://2021.en-t.info/pages/home).

These are not all my projects, but here is more or less basic information, I also wrote projects in go, c, swift and many other languages.
